Description:  
The purpose of this project is to answer the central question, 
What is the fewest number of popular votes you could get 
and still be elected President of the United States of America? 
My code uses data from previous election starting from 1828 til 2020 to calculate information such as 
Total Electoral Votes, Total Popular Votes, and gather data such as state information to then use on the functions
minPopVoteAtLeast() and minPopVoteAtLeastFast() to get the answer for our central question for every election year.
